Be the Cowboy,A Pearl,"you are growing tired of me 
 you love me so hard and i still ca not sleep 
 you are growing tired of me 
 and all the things i do not talk about 
 sorry i do not want your touch 
 it is not that i do not want you 
 sorry i ca not take your touch 
 it is just that i fell in love with a war 
 nobody told me it ended 
 and it left a pearl in my head 
 and i roll it around 
 every night just to watch it glow 
 every night baby that is where i go 
 sorry i do not want your touch 
 it is not that i do not want you 
 sorry i ca not take your touch 
 there is a hole that you fill 
 you fill you fill 
 but it is just that i fell in love with a war 
 and nobody told me it ended 
 and it left a pearl in my head 
 and i roll it around 
 every night just to watch it glow 
 every night baby that is where i go 
 just to watch it glow

Puberty 2,Dan the Dancer,"dan had very long limbs 
 from leading day to day 
 hanging onto a cliff 
 that stretched him everyday 
 and when she would ask to hold hands 
 he would smile and 
 let one of his hands go 
 his whole life in one hand 
 his whole life 
 and when he would say goodnight and 
 leave her doorstep 
 he would use his last strength 
 to wave back 
 and once back in his room 
 once back in his room 
 he would return his waving hand 
 back to its cliff 
 he liked her more than life itself 
 i am sure 
 because dan had never danced outside of his room 
 when no one was home and he would start to hear the door 
 so when he moved with you 
 and felt his body let go 
 of course you could not know 
 it was you and you alone 
 that he had shown his bedroom dancer to 
 shown his bedroom dancer to 
 shown his bedroom dancer to 
 shown his bedroom dancer to 
 shown his bedroom dancer to 
 shown his bedroom dancer to 
 and he would never tell you that it was his first time
